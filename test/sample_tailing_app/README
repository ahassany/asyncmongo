This Tornado test application demonstrates tailable cursors. It creates a
capped collection in the 'test' database and displays a web page at
http://localhost:8888 that streams new documents in the capped collection to the
page.

Try opening several copies of the page and using the app to add documents to the
collection, or clear the collection. You can also use the mongo shell to insert
a document and see it appear in the page.
